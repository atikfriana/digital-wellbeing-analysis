# 🧠 Digital Wellbeing Analysis — How Short-Form Content Affects Focus and Productivity

Hi! I’m **Atika Arifiana**, a Data Analyst enthusiast passionate about using data for real impact.  
This project explores how **short-form content** (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) affects **attention span, productivity, and mental health**, using survey data and public datasets.

📊 Tools used: **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Power BI**

---

## 📌 Project Objective

With the rise of short-form video platforms, many students and young professionals experience decreased focus, increased screen time, and lower productivity.  
This project aims to:
- Analyze behavioral trends in short-form content consumption  
- Investigate correlations with attention span and academic/work performance  
- Build a dashboard that visualizes insights to support digital well-being

## 📊 Key Questions Answered

- Who are the typical users of short-form content?  
- How many hours do they spend daily on social media?  
- Does screen time relate to attention span decline?  
- Are students’ productivity and academic performance affected?  
- What are the most addictive content types?  
- Are there visible health risks associated with excessive use?

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection**
- **Primary:** My own Google Form survey (Indonesia-based)
- **Secondary:** Kaggle dataset: [Students' Health and Academic Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/students-health-and-academic-performance)

### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Cleaned missing values, duplicates, standardized column formats
- Bootstrapped my survey data to improve sample representativeness
- Transformed multi-answer fields and created new features

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**
- 📎 Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Analyzed distributions, segmentations, and correlation heatmaps

### 4. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
- Created 3 dashboard pages:
  - **User Demographics & Content Preferences**
  - **Attention Span vs Screen Time**
  - **Academic Productivity & Health Risks**
- Built DAX-based KPIs and slicers for interactivity

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🎥 **Instagram Reels dominates** — Used by 70% of respondents
- 📱 **4+ hours screen time** correlates with lower attention in 69% of students
- 🧠 **84%** say short videos reduce focus during studying
- 🛌 Users with **poor sleep & eye strain** report more attention problems
- 🎭 Comedy & fast-paced content are most addictive
- 🎯 Most respondents prefer **short videos (<20 sec)** and **struggle with long-form content**

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- ✅ Limit short-form content usage to improve focus
- 📚 Encourage long-form and educational content for cognitive health
- 🧘‍♀️ Practice digital mindfulness: schedule breaks, use screen-time apps
- 🎯 For digital well-being programs, target youth aged 20–30 who are most affected
