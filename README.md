# Attention-Span-Analysis
With the rise of short-form content like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok videos, concerns are growing about its impact on attention span, productivity, and overall well-being. This project aims to analyze how consuming short-format content influences focus and cognitive abilities, affects work and academic productivity, and contributes to social media addiction and its effects on mental well-being.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/innocentmfa/students-health-and-academic-performance

**Data cleaning and pre-processing**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) 
* Bootstrapped the survey dataset to improve sample size to total of 1000 records.
* Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized formats.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and correlations.
Power Bi
* Performed splitting of columns based on delimiters due to rows having multiple values. 
*	Performed unpivoting and indexing.
*	Created derived columns based on existing columns.

**Data analysis & visualization**
*	Created interactive dashboards to compare different user behaviours.
*	Built trend analysis visuals showing various sorts relationships between short-form content consumption and attention span.
*	Used DAX functions to derive key insights on user engagement and focus patterns.
